# AutoHotkeyScripts

A collection of scripts that I've set up and find useful.

## Setup

1. Install AutoHotkey
2. Clone this repository to some directory - Startup script calls other scripts relative to itself.
3. Create a shortcut in the startup folder (run "shell:startup") pointing to startupScripts.ahk to have it run at login
